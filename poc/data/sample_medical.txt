In the field of neurology, Dr. Michael Thompson's work at Massachusetts General Hospital has established clear links between chronic Migraine and Anxiety disorders.

Studies also show that Magnesium supplementation can reduce Migraine frequency.

Dr. Lisa Park at Stanford Medical Center has documented significant improvements in Rheumatoid Arthritis patients treated with DMARDs (Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs) like Methotrexate.
