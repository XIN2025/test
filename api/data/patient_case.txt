Patient John Smith, a 45-year-old software engineer, has been experiencing unexplained fatigue and shortness of breath during physical activities. Over the past six months, he has noticed increased chest discomfort and irregular heartbeat patterns, particularly during his morning jogs. His symptoms worsen significantly with strenuous exercise, and he reports occasionally feeling lightheaded after moderate physical activity. Recent medical examinations revealed slight swelling in his lower extremities and unusual heart sounds during auscultation. Blood pressure readings have been consistently elevated during physical activity. His family history includes several cases of sudden cardiac events before age 50. Despite being generally health-conscious and maintaining an active lifestyle for years, these symptoms have begun interfering with his daily activities. Dr. Sarah Chen, his primary care physician, has noted these concerning patterns and recommended immediate reduction in exercise intensity while further diagnostic tests are conducted.
